## Introduction
Accurate electricity consumption forecasting is crucial for energy management, load planning, and optimizing energy production. This project uses the ARIMA model, a popular statistical method for time-series forecasting, to predict future electricity consumption based on historical data.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing time-series data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data trends, seasonality, and patterns.
- **ARIMA Modeling**: Building and training an ARIMA model for forecasting.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, etc.
- **Forecast Visualization**: Visualizing the forecasted values along with confidence intervals.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical electricity consumption data. You can replace the link below with the actual dataset you're using.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for interactive use)

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/time-series-analysis-python.git
   cd time-series-analysis-python
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Use the `data_preprocessing.py` script to clean and prepare the data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Run the `eda.ipynb` Jupyter notebook to explore the dataset and understand trends and seasonality.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Use the `arima_model.py` script to train the ARIMA model.
   - Configure model parameters like p, d, and q in the script.

4. **Forecasting**:
   - Use the trained model to make predictions for future time periods.

## Modeling
The ARIMA model is built using the following parameters:
- **p**: Number of lag observations included in the model (AR term).
- **d**: Number of times the raw observations are differenced (I term).
- **q**: Size of the moving average window (MA term).

The model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Results
The results of the model, including predictions and performance metrics, are documented in the `results` folder. The `forecast.ipynb` notebook provides visualizations of the forecasted values along with confidence intervals.
